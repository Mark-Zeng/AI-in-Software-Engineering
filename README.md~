# AI in Software Engineering

[6 Ways AI Transforms How We Develop Software](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/sites/mariyayao/2018/04/18/6-ways-ai-transforms-how-we-develop-software/amp/)

## Why Interesting

The article argues that AI is having and will continue to have a great impact on the current software development paradigm. By citing the Google researcher Pete Warden who predicts that "most software jobs won't involve programming", the article puts forward the utimate question that whether AI can create AI. But not to even get into that, the assumptions about how AI could automatically handle errors, refactor codes, or make stategic decisions remain dubious, and seem to be contradicting the rising needs for experienced software engineers these days. While AI indeed changes the way we perceive certain problems, it is mainly used for analysing big data and making simple desicions instead of developing a sophisticated solution, which software enginners are obliged to do. 

> The article focuses on AI's impact on software engineering. Mostly, it argues AI brings an impact because it will take over some of programmer's tasks. Under some circumstances, it could figure out what to do itself.
